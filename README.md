## Processor

The processor file will be loaded relative to the PWD and it must be like this scaffolding:

```js
module.exports = function factory (args, logger) {
  // DO WHAT YOU WANT IN SYNC
  // This function will be called for each REPO you are processing

  return {
    onRepo (repo) {
      // OPTIONAL, sync function called before processing the files
    },
    onFile (file) {
      // MANDATORY, do what you whant to each file of your project.
      // The files are processed sequentially and, if you return a promise
      // it will be waited.
      // If you will throw an error, it will be logged but all will continue
    },
    onComplete (repo) {
      // OPTIONAL, sync function called after all the processed files
    }
  }
}
```
